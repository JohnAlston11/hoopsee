His absence will be his fourth straight, with Jalen  Brunson in line to make his fourth start of the year at the point. Smith Jr. has delivered a strong sophomore campaign in his 20 contests this season at 13.5 points and 4.2 assists per game, but he continues to be on a game-to-game basis as far as his return is concerned. His next chance to suit up comes Thursday versus the Phoenix Suns."
